## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The mobile banking application is currently facing a high user drop-off rate during the onboarding process. While a significant number of users download the application, many fail to complete the registration and account setup process. This drop-off negatively impacts user activation, customer acquisition goals and overall business performance.

The organisation has identified onboarding as a critical area requiring improvement to ensure users can quickly and easily start using the banking services offered by the application.
